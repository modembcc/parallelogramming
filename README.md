# Gamer's diary of CS3210
A bit about me first, I'm a 3.5 cap Y3 student without a job, and this sem I miss my 6th module, so I guess I'll try making good grades in the ones I got.
Maybe detailing what I learnt from this mod will help me review for exams, cuz they are 50%.

I'll keep updating this as the course goes on.
